      severity: High
    then:

    rationale: >
      High severity incidents may require containment actions,
      but isolation must be approved to avoid business impact.

  - name: Medium severity incident
    if:
      severity: Medium
    then:
      tag: true
    rationale: >
      Medium severity incidents warrant triage tagging,
      but not isolation.

    if:
      severity: [Low, Informational]
    then:
      notify: true
    rationale: >
      Low-risk incidents are tracked and communicated only.
